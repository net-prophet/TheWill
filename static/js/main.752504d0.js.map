Despite this, dApp voting has yet to permeate any mainstream communities because of classic blockchain onboarding problems \\u2014 there\\'s no simple voting dApp for small communities that makes it easy to get started \"just counting votes\" for a group of nontechnical users. On-chain governance is a roadblock because real world organizations don\\'t exist on-chain. We propose a straightforward and easy-to-use dApp that any group, organization or government can implement straight away to begin recording votes with blockchain, while still retaining their off-chain governance structures. We introduce a voting mechanism that, using an external token as a voting marker, can be used to implement either one-person-one-vote structures or stake-weighted voting schemes, with support for a \"liquid democracy\" delegation pattern.',\n\t            _react2.default.createElement(\n\t              'h3',\n\t              null,\n\t              'Governance is only possible with the consent and the trust of the governed'\n\t            ),\n\t            _react2.default.createElement(\n\t              'b',\n\t              null,\n\t              'It\\'s imperative to understand that our app is built around the \"Verify, Don\\'t Trust\" philosophy,'\n\t            ),\n\t            ' and explicitly eschews any on-chain governance mechanisms. At the end of each voting period, we don\\'t mark a proposal as PASSED/FAILED until one of the Board Members returns after a proposal closes and honestly reports the results (or, with a good reason, instead chooses \"FORCED\" or \"REJECTED\" override). The tools are available for anyone to check the full history of the vote and tally the final count, but trust in the board members to behave honestly is implied. This is important for 2 main reasons. Firstly, on-chain governance is largely incompatible with existing legal systems, because almost every organization on Earth is accountable to some jurisdiction \\u2014 What if your smart contract votes in favor of funding a nuclear program in a sanctioned country? Being a DAO doesn\\'t suddenly enable illegal activity or absolve the developer in a treason, terror or murder investigation. Second, by refusing to address the topic of on-chain governance, we force our application to be the purest version of what it is intended for, which is a historical registry and trusted single source of truth, not a rigid robotic enforcer that must be obeyed.

Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n\t * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n\t * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {(state) => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n\t * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n\t * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n\t * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n\t * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n\t * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * state = { in: false };\n\t *\n\t * toggleEnterState = () => {\n\t *   this.setState({ in: true });\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * render() {\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <div>\n\t *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n\t *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   );\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n\t * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n\t *\n\t * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t *\n\t * ## Timing\n\t *\n\t * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n\t * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n\t * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n\t * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n\t * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n\t *\n\t * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n\t * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n\t * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n\t * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n\t * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n\t * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n\t * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n\t * > for more info).

Despite this, dApp voting has yet\n          to permeate any mainstream communities because of classic blockchain\n          onboarding problems &mdash; there's no simple voting dApp for small communities\n          that makes it easy to get started \"just counting votes\" for a group of\n          nontechnical users. On-chain governance is a roadblock because real world\n          organizations don't exist on-chain. We propose a straightforward and easy-to-use\n          dApp that any group, organization or government can implement straight away\n          to begin recording votes with blockchain, while still retaining their off-chain\n          governance structures. We introduce a voting mechanism that, using an external\n          token as a voting marker, can be used to implement either one-person-one-vote\n          structures or stake-weighted voting schemes, with support for a \"liquid democracy\"\n          delegation pattern.\n\n          <h3>Governance is only possible with the consent and the trust of the governed</h3>\n\n          <b>It's imperative to understand that our app is built around the \"Verify, Don't Trust\"\n          philosophy,</b> and explicitly eschews any on-chain governance mechanisms.\n          At the end of each voting period, we don't mark a proposal as PASSED/FAILED\n          until one of the Board Members returns after a proposal\n          closes and honestly reports the results (or, with a good reason, instead chooses\n          \"FORCED\" or \"REJECTED\" override). The tools are available for anyone to check the full\n          history of the vote and tally the final count, but trust in the board members to behave\n          honestly is implied. This is important for 2 main reasons. Firstly, on-chain governance\n          is largely incompatible with existing legal systems, because almost every organization\n          on Earth is accountable to some jurisdiction &mdash; What if your smart contract votes in\n          favor of funding a nuclear program in a sanctioned country? Being a DAO doesn't suddenly\n          enable illegal activity or absolve the developer in a treason, terror or murder\n          investigation. Second, by refusing to address the topic of on-chain governance, we force\n          our application to be the purest version of what it is intended for, which is a historical\n          registry and trusted single source of truth, not a rigid robotic enforcer that must be\n          obeyed. If the people do not trust the government to execute their will,\n          a dApp cannot fix this &mdash; only revolution can.\n          \n          \n        </CardContent>\n        <CardActions>\n

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state = { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * ## Timing\n *\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n *\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable.
